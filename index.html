      <p> <b>Python</b> is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming
        language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available
        under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on <b>Python
          programming</b> language.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="why_to_learn_python?">
      <header >Why to Learn Python?</header>

      <p><b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is
        designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation,
        and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

      <p><b>Python</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
        when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Python is Interpreted</b> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile
          your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
        <li><b>Python is Interactive</b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter
          directly to write your programs.</li>
        <li><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that
          encapsulates code within objects</li>
        <li><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and
          supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Characteristics_of_Python" >
      <header >Characteristics of Python</header>
      <p>Following are important characteristics of <b>Python Programming</b> −</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
        <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
        <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
        <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
        <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World_using_Python">
      <header >Hello World using Python</header>
      <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello
        World program, You can try it using Demo link.</p>
      <code>print ("Hello, Python!");</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Applications_of_Python">
      <header >Applications of Python</header>

      <p>As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them
        here:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Easy-to-learn </b> − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows
          the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
        <li><b>Easy-to-read</b>− Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
        <li><b>Easy-to-maintain</b> − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
        <li><b>A broad standard library</b>− Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible
          on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
        <li><b>Interactive Mode </b>− Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and
          debugging of snippets of code.</li>
        <li><b>Portable</b>− Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all
          platforms.</li>
        <li><b>Extendable </b> − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable
          programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
        <li><b>Databases </b>− Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
        <li><b>GUI Programming</b>− Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system
          calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
        <li><b>Scalable </b>− Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Interactive_Mode_Programming">
      <header >Interactive Mode Programming</header>
      <p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt −</p>

      <code>$ python  
        Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43) 
        [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on  linux2br 
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" 
        for more information. 
        >>></code>

      <p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter −</p>

      <code>>>> print "Hello, Python!"</code>

      <code>>>> print "Hello, Python!"</code>

      <p>If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with parenthesis as in
        print ("Hello, Python!");. However in Python version 2.4.3, this produces the following result −</p>

      <code>Hello, Python!
        </code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Python_Identifiers">
      <header >Python Identifiers</header>
      <p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An
        identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
        underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>

      <p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive
        programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Reserved_Words">
      <header >Reserved Words</header>

      <p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constant or
        variable or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>


      <div id="table-reserved-words">
